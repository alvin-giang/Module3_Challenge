### Module3_Challenge
## Python Challenge
In this Challenge, I have created two Python scripts to analyse the real world datasets to show how powerful Python could be with handling with big data, and export the results to text files.
# PyBank
In this Challenge, I have created a Python script to analysis the financial report of this company based on a data set. By using Python, I have done some analysis and determined these following valuse:
    The total number of months
    The net total amount of "Profit/ Losses" over the entire period
    The changes in "Profit/Losses" and the average of those change
    The greatest increase and decrease in profit (with date and amount) over the period
Those findings has also been write in a seperate text file.
#PyPol,
In this Challenge, I have created a Python script to help a small rural U.S. town modernise its vote-counting process based on a set of poll data. By using Python, I have done some analysis and calculated some following values:
    The total number of votes cast
    The percentage list of candidates 
    The percentage of votes each candidate won
    The total number of votes each candidate won
    The winner of the election based on popular vote
Those findings has also been write in a seperate text file.
